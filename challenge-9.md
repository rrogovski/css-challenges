## CSS Grid
Much has been said about the *new* values ​​of the `display` property, one of which is the **grid**.
The display: grid allows you to make a grid system natively, without lib.

In this challenged you will be a little more challenged.
You will not only have to apply the challenge once, but twice.

You should make a layout of an 'admins' / 'dashboards' style application that uses `grid-template`, and you should also develop totalizer cards that are responsive.

  #### What you'll use
- display: grid
- grid-area
- grid-template-columns
- responsiveness (@media)


#### Rules
 Use only HTML and CSS.


#### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
- Create a dashboard-style layout with at least side menu and main content
- Create cards arranged in *grid system*, at least four cards.
- The page is suitable to be resized.
