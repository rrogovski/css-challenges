## Toggle
  Now it's time to play a little bit more with css and now mixed with Semantic HTML.
    
  In this challenge you'll have to implement a toggle input only with HTML and CSS

  ##### What is Toggle?
  You may know it as switch or boolean input, that 'yes or now' clickable inputs, you can checkout a little in [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=toggle&sxsrf=ALeKk00Tv4wP5JJyuqrBH26w0pTJppd5cw:1588477004174&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ6MT84ZbpAhXTGbkGHWfoC0IQ_AUoAXoECBMQAw&biw=1322&bih=669#imgrc=AXzEwrAQSoo-JM)

#### What you'll use
  - Siblings selectors
  - Pseudo selectors
  - Transition  
  
  #### Rules
  Use only HTML and CSS. 
  To be easer you can use checkbox input.
  
  #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
  - The toggle *goes* from one side to another when clicked/changed value
  - The toggle *change color* when value changed
  - Transitions, color and place, must be smooth
  - Respect HTML Semantics
