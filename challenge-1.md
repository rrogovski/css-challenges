## Variables
This challenge is for those who don't know or are not familiar with variables in css

You can pick up any model you already use or find it online.
If you use a ready-made model like the bootstrap that is usually gray, add 4 colors to them.

You must change colors and values ​​to be used in variables.
#### Rules
Only HTML and CSS can be used;

#### Requirements
- all colors must be in a variable
- numbers that are used often like: margins, padding, border thickness and must also be in variables;

You can view the model I made on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/schirrel/full/PoPOzKY).

[This is the original model](https://codepen.io/schirrel/full/Vwvrjbq), where you can see that it exists as a variable, but it is not being used.
