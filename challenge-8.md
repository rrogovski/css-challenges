## Animation
Do you like gradient? Well I like it a lot, and it's also a trend in UI.
Many websites / products when loading their *assets* display a loading background where they give the feeling that something is 'running'.

In this challenge you must make a gradient background and its rotation angle is animated, going from 0 to 360.

  #### What you'll use
 - animation
 - @keyframes


 #### Rules
Â  Use only HTML and CSS.


 #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
 - It will not be necessary to create any tags, you can use the same body
 - Create an animation to rotate the angle
 - This animation must be infinite
