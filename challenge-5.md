## Modal
You think is possble to open and close a modal windows without JavaScript? 

*Spoiler* Yes it is!
Thanks to Semantic HTML.

 In this challenge you will implement a modal window, that opens and close only with css and semantics html.
 Far from the previus challenges, where you just create the compoment, here we want you to apply it on a page.

  #### What you'll use
  - Semantic HTML (`for="")
  - Siblings selectors (`+`, `~`)
  - Pseudo Seletores (`:`)
  
  
 
  
  
  #### Rules
   Use only HTML and CSS. 
  
  
  #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
  - Creat a *look like* button to open the modal
  - Shows a backdrop for the modal with the model.
  - Close the modal from inside.
