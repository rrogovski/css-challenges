## Input with Icon
It sounds simple doesn't it?

And yet we see that most libraries have a different approach to this, or else they put borders / backgrounds / highlights on the icons that we often only want to add to the input.

That's what we're going to do
  #### What you'll use
 - Pseudo Classes / Selectors
 - position
 - padding


 #### Rules
Â  Use only HTML and CSS.


 #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
 - The input has an icon, it can be the right or the left the choice is yours
 - The icon library is also your choice

If you still want to 'season' more if you challenge you can:
- Change the color of the icon when the input is in focus
or
- Show / Hide show the icon only in one state, with focus or without
