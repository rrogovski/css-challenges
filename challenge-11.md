## Collapsible Side Menu
You have seen in previous challenges how to use input checkbox and its pseudo-classes to apply styles.
Shall we 'raise' the level?
In this challenge you should make a menu that 'closes' or 'opens' with css only.

  #### What you'll use
 - Weekly HTML, input checkbox
 - Pseudo Classes / Selectors
 - Sibling selectors
 - transform
 - transition


 #### Rules
Â  Use only HTML and CSS.


 #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
 - Show or hide the menu
 - There is a visual element that says whether the menu is open or closed
 - have a smooth transition
