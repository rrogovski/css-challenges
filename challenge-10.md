## SVG
This challenge goes beyond CSS, it is to teach you a tool or better, an incredible option than HTML.
SVG are nothing more than *tags*, yes, tags, just like we use in HTML, but SVG is considered an XML.

Have you ever imagined *drawing* images with only tags? No canvas, no png, no jpeg. Purely **text**? That's what I love about SVG.

SVGs are widely used in icons, and also in animations within applications and websites.

  #### What you'll use
- svg
- animation
- keyframes
- transform
- css properties that work only with svg;


#### Rules
Â Use only HTML and CSS.


#### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
- Use an svg icon that symbolizes loading, see [reference](# references)
- Animate the edge of this icon
- Animate the icon color
- If your icon fits with rotation, rotate, otherwise use Y or X movement.

You can use the [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/) or [Icon8](https://icons8.com.br/) websites.

If you don't feel like choosing an icon, you can use the [icon](../assets/icon.svg) i used .
